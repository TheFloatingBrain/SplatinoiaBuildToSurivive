# Splatinoia-Build-To-Surivive
RUN! JUMP! BUILD! To escape the splats! These squishy creatures will kill but only if you let them. Build shelters, stairs, traps, etc. to survive as long as possible.

# Note
Included a build script and manifest file with 2 simple commands (these may be copied into a shell/shell script fairly easily) so the game may be ran and played. Unfortunately later versions of this game were lost, unfortunately I think this is one of the earlier builds.
